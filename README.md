# Coffee Machine Simulator (Python)

A console-based coffee machine simulation built using Python.  
This project mimics the basic working of a real coffee vending machine, including order selection, resource checking, and payment handling.

# Features
- Displays a coffee machine logo using a separate Python file
- Allows users to choose between:
  - Espresso
  - Latte
  - Cappuccino
- Checks if sufficient ingredients are available before preparing coffee
- Accepts coin-based payment (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies)
- Calculates total money inserted and returns change
- Updates machine resources after each successful order
- Provides a **report** command to view current resources and money
- Supports turning off the machine using the `off` command

# What I Learned / Revised from This Project
- Using **dictionaries** to manage menu items and resources
- Applying **functions** to organize logic (payment, resource checking, updates)
- Implementing **conditional logic and loops**
- Handling **user input and validation**
- Working with **multiple Python files and imports**
- Simulating a **real-world system** using core Python concepts
